# Hospital Performance Analysis Using R

This repository contains the R code and data used for analyzing hospital performance based on various healthcare metrics. The project aims to provide insights into hospital quality across different states in the U.S., focusing on 30-day mortality rates for conditions such as heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia.

## Overview
The **Hospital Performance Analysis** project is designed to help researchers, policymakers, and the general public assess hospital performance using publicly available healthcare data. The analysis covers a range of medical outcomes and allows for comparison of hospital quality across different states.

## Data Sources
The primary dataset used in this analysis is the **Outcome of Care Measures** dataset, which includes 30-day mortality rates and other hospital quality metrics. This data is obtained from publicly available healthcare repositories.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- `scripts/`: Includes R scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- `functions/`: Custom R functions used in the analysis (e.g., `best()` for identifying top hospitals).
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations summarizing the findings.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.
- `LICENSE`: Licensing information.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to have R installed on your system. You can install the required packages by running the following command in R:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr"))
```

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-performance-analysis.git
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, you can start the analysis by running the R scripts provided in the `scripts/` directory. For example:

```r
# Load the required functions
source("functions/best.R")

# Run the analysis for a specific state and outcome
best("TX", "heart attack")
```

## Features
- **Hospital Ranking**: Identify hospitals with the best (lowest) 30-day mortality rates.
- **State-wise Comparison**: Compare hospital performance across different states.
- **Visualizations**: Generate charts and graphs to visualize the data and findings.
- **Reports**: Automated report generation summarizing the analysis.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
